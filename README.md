# BrokenBlock
PaperMC plugin for Minecraft.

This plugin shows the block that was broken by the player and how many blocks the player has broken.

## Features
* Chat command: Turn the displaying on and off. Display the information about a player.
* Everytime a block is broken (and the displaying is on) the player will recieve chat messages of what, and with what the block was broken. When hovering the broken block shows the id of the block, who, where and when the block was broken, while hovering the item used shows more information about the item.

## Commands
Prefix: `brokenblock`, `bb`.
```
/brokenblock toggle
/brokenblock toggle <on/off>

/brokenblock player
/brokenblock player <playername>
```

## About
This plugin was my first Java & Minecraft plugin development of 2 day.
It was not made to be a useful plugin, but rather to test and learn.

Thanks for all the help and support from PaperMC's Discord Community.
